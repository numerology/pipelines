    "# GCP Dataflow Component Sample\n",
    "A Kubeflow Pipeline component that prepares data by submitting an Apache Beam job (authored in Python) to Cloud Dataflow for execution. The Python Beam code is run with Cloud Dataflow Runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended use\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this component to run a Python Beam code to submit a Cloud Dataflow job as a step of a Kubeflow pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Runtime arguments\n",
    "Name | Description | Optional |  Data type| Accepted values | Default |\n",
    ":--- | :----------| :----------| :----------| :----------| :---------- |\n",
    "python_file_path |  The path to the Cloud Storage bucket or local directory containing the Python file to be run. |  |  GCSPath |  |  |\n",
    "project_id |  The ID of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project  containing the Cloud Dataflow job.| | GCPProjectID | | |\n",
    "staging_dir  |   The path to the Cloud Storage directory where the staging files are stored. A random subdirectory will be created under the staging directory to keep the  job information.This is done so that you can resume the job in case of failure. `staging_dir` is passed as the command line arguments (`staging_location` and `temp_location`) of the Beam code. |   Yes  |   GCSPath  |   |   None  |\n",
    "requirements_file_path |   The path to the Cloud Storage bucket or local directory containing the pip requirements file. | Yes | GCSPath |  | None |\n",
    "args |  The list of arguments to pass to the Python file. | No |  List | A list of string arguments | None |\n",
    "wait_interval |  The number of seconds to wait between calls to get the status of the job. | Yes | Integer  |  | 30 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input data schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you use the component, the following files must be ready in a Cloud Storage bucket:\n",
    "- A Beam Python code file.\n",
    "- A  `requirements.txt` file which includes a list of dependent packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beam Python code should follow the [Beam programming guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/) as well as the following additional requirements to be compatible with this component:\n",
    "- It accepts the command line arguments `--project`, `--temp_location`, `--staging_location`, which are [standard Dataflow Runner options](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-pipeline-options).\n",
    "- It enables `info logging` before the start of a Cloud Dataflow job in the Python code. This is important to allow the component to track the status and ID of the job that is created. For example, calling `logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)` before any other code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "Name | Description\n",
    ":--- | :----------\n",
    "job_id | The id of the Cloud Dataflow job that is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cautions & requirements\n",
    "To use the components, the following requirements must be met:\n",
    "- Cloud Dataflow API is enabled.\n",
    "- The component is running under a secret Kubeflow user service account in a Kubeflow Pipeline cluster.  For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "component_op(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Kubeflow user service account is a member of:\n",
    "- `roles/dataflow.developer` role of the project.\n",
    "- `roles/storage.objectViewer` role of the Cloud Storage Objects `python_file_path` and `requirements_file_path`.\n",
    "- `roles/storage.objectCreator` role of the Cloud Storage Object `staging_dir`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed description\n",
    "The component does several things during the execution:\n",
    "- Downloads `python_file_path` and `requirements_file_path` to local files.\n",
    "- Starts a subprocess to launch the Python program.\n",
    "- Monitors the logs produced from the subprocess to extract the Cloud Dataflow job information.\n",
    "- Stores the Cloud Dataflow job information in `staging_dir` so the job can be resumed in case of failure.\n",
    "- Waits for the job to finish.\n",
